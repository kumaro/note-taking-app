<!-- Note-Taking App - Interview Assignment
===============

Sample project used as part of interview process.


##Instructions

Your task is to build an Angular app for managing personal notes (think Evernote). The app should use Angular to allow the user to create/edit/view notes without refreshing the whole page.

Please clone this repo and create your own branch to work in. When you are ready to submit your work, open a pull request.

##Requirements

* User should have list of notes
* User should be able to create, view, edit and delete notes
* User should be able to write the note in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* When a user selects a note, the noteâ€™s markdown should be rendered to HTML and displayed
* Page should be responsive for mobile and tablet
* Only needs to work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox)

**Bonus Points**

* For saving the data for the user in the browser, so data is persisted when the user comes back
* For geotagging the notes with current location
* For creating an "About" page and linking to it using Angular Routing (no page refresh)
* For any additional features that increase the usefulness of the tool -->
